This assignment will reinforce your understanding of Râ€™s data structures, mapping
functions, and version control concepts covered in Lectures 2-4. You will practice
working with different data structures, apply mapping functions, and implement
memory-efficient code. The Palmer Penguins dataset will serve as our primary
dataset for this assignment.
